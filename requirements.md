# Software Requirements

The vision of our product is to create a utility tool for developers to use while working on their projects. This tool will allow them to log and track bugs as they arise and keep track of resolved issues. This will give developers the ability to reflect on their project's progress and identify the cause of other bugs if they are related.

## Scope

### IN

- The app will allow users to input bugs and store records of them in local storage
- The app will allow users to assign bugs as open, in-progress or completed
- Users will be able to view all closed bugs within an archive page
- Users will be able to view contact information and bios about the developers

### OUT

- Users will not have the ability to collaborate on bugs with other users
- This app will not be responsive

## MVP

The app will be able to take user input and add bugs to a list of open bugs. When bugs have been resolved, the app will add the bugs to the closed bug archive.

## Stretch Goals

- An editable pop up for each open bug
- Dynamic animations on the about us page
- Make app responsive to desktops, tablets and phones
- Resolution type
